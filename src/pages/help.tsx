            Ideamarket uses markets to permanently change the incentives of
            content curation.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the process, Ideamarket establishes a new passive income stream
            for creators, without the conflicts of interest attendant to ads,
            subscriptions, donations, and other common business models.

            Ideamarket lists Twitter accounts on an exchange. To increase an
            account’s rank, buy upvotes. Upvotes bought later cost more.
            <br />
            <br />
            Token price and supply are managed by a bonding curve. The first
            1,000 tokens for each listing cost $0.10 each. Price increases by
            $0.01 for each 100 tokens minted thereafter.
            <br />

          <h3>Is Ideamarket a prediction market?</h3>
          <p>
            Ideamarket is not a prediction market.
            <br />
            <br />
            On a prediction market:
          </p>
          <ul style={{ listStyle: 'square inside' }}>
            <li>Winners and losers are decided by specific events</li>
            <li>The market closes at a certain moment</li>
            <li>An oracle reports what’s “true”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Ideamarket is like a commodity market:</p>
          <ul style={{ listStyle: 'square inside' }}>
            <li>Winners and losers are decided by market cycles</li>
            <li>The market never closes — it’s perpetual</li>
            <li>
              There’s no oracle or “source of truth." Instead, the market
              aggregates its participants’ subjective judgments from moment to
              moment
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="faq-prediction-manipulation">
          <h3>Can’t [a rich person] manipulate the market?</h3>
          <p>
            Ideamarket is superior to typical markets in that{' '}
            <strong>listings can only be manipulated upwards</strong>.<br />
            This is because rank is determined by each token’s circulating
            supply. A short-seller would need to borrow tokens in order to
            short-sell them, and borrowing them would require minting them —
            increasing the circulating supply.
            <strong>
              Thus, short-selling is technically impossible on Ideamarket
            </strong>
            .<br />
            Like any existing market, there’s nothing explicitly preventing a
            rich person from inflating a listing’s capitalization. But no amount
            of money can artificially reduce the ranking of a listing they don’t
            like.

          <h3>Is a ‘listing owner’ the same as a ‘listing submitter’?</h3>
          <p>
            No. You can add @naval’s twitter account as a listing to the Twitter
            market, but only Naval can claim ownership of the interest that
            accrues to his account. He can do this by clicking “Verify” at the

          <h2>3. PHILOSOPHY</h2>
          <p>
            Ideamarket’s founding goal is to curate information sources without
            a centralized third party to offer a stamp of legitimacy (a
            mainstream media organization, for example). If Ideamarket becomes
            the new “arbiter of credibility,” replacing corporate anointment
            with public skin-in-the-game, it becomes more profitable to earn
            trust than to fake it. Genuinely trusted voices attain a high rank
            "for free" as their audience buys upvotes out of sincere belief and
            self-interest, while fake voices must pay out of pocket. Over time,
            market cycles shake out both the deceivers and the deceived.
