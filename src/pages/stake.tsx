      As Ideamarket is on the Arbitrum layer 2 network, you’ll need to bridge ETH from Ethereum L1 to Arbitrum to be able to buy listing tokens, or to create new on-chain listings.

In upcoming products, $IMO will be used to pay for platform-specific features.

           Retroactive Airdrop — 5%

           Community rewards — 32%

           Verification rewards — 2%
           Future rewards programs: 13%
